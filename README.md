# Rules
If you find this prefab useful, all I ask is a simple credit somewhere or a "Thanks message" on my Discord server or twitter.

# Warning
This is a beta version, the configuration is messy and not optimal.

Makes sure that the camera deactivates itself when the player reset his ShapesKey(Viseme)
