# Rules
If you find this prefab useful, all I ask is a simple credit somewhere or a "Thanks message" on my Discord server or twitter.

# Warning
This is a beta version, the configuration is messy and not optimal.

The Desktop Camera that allows you to zoom in and out doesn't work anymore.

Makes sure that the camera deactivates itself when the player reset his ShapesKey(Viseme)
